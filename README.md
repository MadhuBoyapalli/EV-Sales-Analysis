Project Overview
This project aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of electric vehicle (EV) sales, identifying key trends and patterns in the EV market. By examining market penetration, growth rates, and the performance of top and bottom EV manufacturers and states, this analysis provides valuable insights into the rapidly evolving EV landscape. The objective is to offer actionable intelligence to stakeholders, aiding in strategic decision-making.

## About the EV Market
The electric vehicle market is experiencing swift expansion worldwide, with new manufacturers entering the field and states supporting infrastructure growth. This project captures a snapshot of this dynamic sector, focusing on market penetration, growth potential, and regional performance in India.

## Tools Used
To deliver effective analysis and visualization, I employed a robust toolkit:
SQL Server: Used for advanced querying and data manipulation to derive meaningful insights.
Canva: Utilized for designing a polished presentation of the project findings.

## Key Findings & Insights
Throughout this project, the following critical insights were uncovered:
### Penetration Analysis: Calculated market penetration across regions, highlighting areas with strong and weak adoption of EVs.
### Growth Insights: Determined the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) to evaluate market expansion over time.
### Top and Bottom Makers: Identified leading and lagging EV manufacturers, aiding in competitive benchmarking.
### State-Level Performance: Assessed state-wise EV sales, offering a regional perspective on EV market penetration and growth.
### Negative Penetration: Analyzed declines in certain areas, which can help focus efforts on regions requiring more support.
These findings play a pivotal role in understanding the trajectory of the EV market and will serve as a reference point for strategic initiatives in the industry.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned
Through this project, I further developed my SQL skills, particularly in querying and analyzing large datasets to extract actionable insights. I also honed my data visualization abilities, crafting an informative presentation to make complex data accessible and engaging for stakeholders.
